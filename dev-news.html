    <h1>Development News!</h1>
      <h3>3/8/19</h3>
    <p>
      It's been a hellish year, but I'm finally back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I stopped coding, I tried to add pictures to the squares and broke it, then ran out of spoons in
      spectacular fashion. I've been back for a few days, fixing bugs and making the game work again. Happy
      news: it does! So, new features:
      <ul>
        <li>A restart button that restarts the game!</li>
        <li>Pretty pictures!</li>
        <li>Some bug fixes!</li>
    </ul>
      Next up for me:
    <ul>
      <li>Making responsiveness work better (or, really, at all) so you can play on mobile</li>
    </ul>
     Also planned:
    <ul>
      <li>Some more design, to make the site a bit prettier (especially the scoreboard)</li>
      <li>Levels and targets of varying kinds</li>
      <li>Playing with difficulty levels in some way</li>
      <li>Special squares</li>
      <li>And more!</li>
    </ul>
      As you see, I'm full of plans! Development is likely to go in bursts, because I'm that kind of person.
      But I'm here for now and this is slowly improving!

      Hello! I'm Lee and this is a match-3 game that's slowly in development.
    </p>
    <p>
       Currently working:
      <ul>
        <li>Match detection!</li>
        <li>Sensible click behaviour!</li>
        <li>Game over detection!</li>
        <li>A matchless starter board!</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
  <p>
    Next up:
    <ul>
      <li>The ability to restart the game when it's over</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Also on the list:
    <ul>
      <li>Making the website look minimally pretty</li>
