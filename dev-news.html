    <p>
      Some more development today! A little news!
      <ul>
        <li>The game over notice now disappears when you start a new level!</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug where the game was calculating the score as many times as there were squares matched - giving you triple or more the score you earned! Scoring is now considerably less generous</li>
        <li>The project is now on <a href="https://github.com/LeanderMcL/sunset-weaver">Github!</a></li>
    </ul>
    Next up:
    <ul>
      <li>Responsive text sizing, so the game looks right on various screen sizes</li>
    </ul>
    And after that:
    <ul>
      <li>Setting the size of images on the buttons according to the screen size, so the game looks better on different screen sizes</li>
      <li>Some prettification of the scoreboard so it looks the way I want</li>
      <li>A refactor to make the code run a bit more efficiently</li>
      <li>Another refactor to prepare me for being able to generate different levels</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

      It's been a hellish year, but I'm finally back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I stopped coding, I tried to add pictures to the squares and broke it, then ran out of spoons in
      spectacular fashion. I've been back for a few days, fixing bugs and making the game work again. Happy
      news: it does! So, new features:
      <ul>
        <li>A restart button that restarts the game!</li>
        <li>Pretty pictures!</li>
        <li>Some bug fixes!</li>
    </ul>
      Next up for me:
    <ul>
      <li>Making responsiveness work better (or, really, at all) so you can play on mobile</li>
    </ul>
     Also planned:
    <ul>
      <li>Some more design, to make the site a bit prettier (especially the scoreboard)</li>
      <li>Levels and targets of varying kinds</li>
      <li>Playing with difficulty levels in some way</li>
      <li>Special squares</li>
      <li>And more!</li>
    </ul>
      As you see, I'm full of plans! Development is likely to go in bursts, because I'm that kind of person.
      But I'm here for now and this is slowly improving!

      Hello! I'm Lee and this is a match-3 game that's slowly in development.
    </p>
    <p>
       Currently working:
      <ul>
        <li>Match detection!</li>
        <li>Sensible click behaviour!</li>
        <li>Game over detection!</li>
        <li>A matchless starter board!</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
  <p>
    Next up:
    <ul>
      <li>The ability to restart the game when it's over</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Also on the list:
    <ul>
      <li>Making the website look minimally pretty</li>
      <li>Level targets of various kinds</li>
      <li>Hints if you haven't made a move for a while</li>
      <li>Maybe a timer</li>
</ul>
